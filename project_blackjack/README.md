This application can be found in the "Programming by doing" series by Graham Mitchell.

It pits the user up against the computer by letting the user draw 2 cards between 2-11 and adding up the total.

The computer(dealer) will then do the same.

Each player gets 2 rounds.

If one players total is above 21 then the other player wins.
